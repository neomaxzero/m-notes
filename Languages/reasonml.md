# Day 1

Key discoverings:
 - The type system is great.
 - The compilation errors are not the bests.
 - HMR is not built-in by default.
 - Styling is pretty much immature (bs-css). (~4 repos for this issue in gh, as the time of writting this).
 - Modules are exported by default, you don't have to export a default module.
  Is hard for me to keep in mind that file name actually is the name of the module exported. Is really a good decition tooked since it enforces you to have clear names inside your files.
