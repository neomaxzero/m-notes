# Day 1

Key discoverings:
 - The type system is great.
 - The compilation errors are not the bests.
 - HMR is not built-in by default.
 - Styling is pretty much immature (bs-css). (~4 repos for this issue in gh, as the time of writting this).
 - Modules are exported by default, you don't have to export a default module.
  Is hard for me to keep in mind that file name actually is the name of the module exported. Is really a good decition tooked since it enforces you to have clear names inside your files.

# Day 2

Cooldn't play that much today.
Key discoverings:
 - Reset CSS is not that easy to do that in plain react.
 - If I have not understood Variant types. Polimorphic types are also new and hard to digest.
 - I Added a button and there are some keywords having conflicts with the language such type on buttons and inputs.
 
  
# Day 3

Today was pretty much a lot better than yesterday.
There is still a lot of confusion on how the self behaves.
I started playing around with the reducer component. Is pretty much a reducer from redux but a littel different.
I wanted to avoid having a lot of code inside the make function but i wasn't able to get rid of that self.
I'll keep trying to have a more readable code.
It seems that every event handler needs to dispatch a call to a reducer in order to do something.
changes are explicit and unchanges also.
I don't like how sometimes you can use the pipe operator to pass arguments to functions but in some cases i couldn't.
Pretty much today overall was not positive to reason. I will obviously keep trying until day 60! I believe is enough. 5 little projects that will help have a grasp of the language.
