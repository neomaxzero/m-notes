# Day 1

Key discoverings:
 - The type system is great.
 - The compilation errors are not the bests.
 - HMR is not built-in by default.
 - Styling is pretty much immature (bs-css). (~4 repos for this issue in gh, as the time of writting this).
 - Modules are exported by default, you don't have to export a default module.
  Is hard for me to keep in mind that file name actually is the name of the module exported. Is really a good decition tooked since it enforces you to have clear names inside your files.

# Day 2

Cooldn't play that much today.
Key discoverings:
 - Reset CSS is not that easy to do that in plain react.
 - If I have not understood Variant types. Polimorphic types are also new and hard to digest.
 - I Added a button and there are some keywords having conflicts with the language such type on buttons and inputs.
