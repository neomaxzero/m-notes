## Course Finished

A few questions I come up with to give my personal opinion about this subject.

* How was the lectures?
  There were a rollercoaster of different levels of emotions and knowledge levels. Most of the lectures have something that is key on it. I'm sure that I cannot grab the key things in one shoot, but I got most of the philosophy intended.

* Would you watch it enterily again?
  Nop. It was too broad. I understand the course was intended to be generic and with a wide variety. I would prefer something more deep and specific.

* Which episodes do you recommend?
  The one of Culture by Brayan Chesky and the one of how to manage are definitily great.

* How are you going to proceed with all this new knowledge?
  I will let my mind rest about this topic for a few days and then re check my notes to see what I should re make or if i completely lost the entire lecture i will try to set up a reviewing.

* Would you recommend watching the entire course to someone else?
  Yes! Definitely, there is no much well structured courses like this and is free!! :D

Overall: 3.4/5
