# Day 1 - vue-cli and images

* Vue have a template format that mixed template with script and css.
* I don't think that would scale that much.
* It seems like there are a lot of ways to split the files.
* I use the vue-cli and is as good as the create react app. It might be even better.
* I come from a react background and I've found a lot of similarities.
* I added styled components and started splitting into different files.
* The vue loader only grab static files if you specify the src of the image directly in the html tag, not from the src of the component.
* I fixed it moving the file to the static public folder!
